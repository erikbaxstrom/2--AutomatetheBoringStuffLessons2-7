# Some notes from Automate the Boring Stuff with Python. Lessons 2-7


if True == True:  # the part after the if is called a condition
    print('true is true') # this is a block. in Python, code blocks start with a colon and are indented. 



# True and False are the only boolean values. But many things are are truthy or falsey

bool(True)
bool(False)

bool('') # falsey
bool('anything that is not blank')

bool(0) #falsey
bool(15) #any int that isn't zero

bool(0.0) #falsey
bool(1.5) # any float that isn't zero

bool([]) # empty list is falsey
bool(['5',15]) # this list has stuff in it and is truthy




# Break
def yourName():
    while True:
        print('please type your name.')
        name = input()
        if name == 'your name':
            break   # break: immediately leaves the while loop. Prints 'thank you' and then is done. 
    print('thank you')

# Continue
def countSpam():
    spam = 0
    while spam < 5:
        spam += 1
        if spam == 3:
            continue # Continue: immediately jumps back to the start of the loop and rechecks the condition. Does not print if spam is equal to three. 
        print('Spam is', spam)


# For, range()
def jimmyFiveTimes():
    print('My name is')
    for i in range(5): # this is the range function. It returns a range object of range data type.
                       # the range function can also be called w/ more parameters: range( start, stop [, step]).
                       # range(5) is the same as range(0,5,1)
                       # can also be called with negative numbers, like range(5, -2, -1) to start at five and decrement by 1 until -2
        print('Jimmy Five Times', i)
    for i in range(0,5,2): # This will execute only when i is inside the range 0-5. It will execute for 0, 2, 4, and then stop, since 6 is outside the range.
        print('what is going to happen?!', i)
